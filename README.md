<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What I've been up to:</span>

I've gone through some life changes in the last year and have been struggling in different parts of my life, whether its mental health or physical health. Try and see the light at the end of the tunnel and realizing that my Higher Power has something in store for me. I've learned to live in the moment and I know that difficult times will past and its only a phase. I've been working on learning how to code Java, I use a gaming client called "Runelite" and sometimes I need a plugin that it doesn't have; This is why I am trying to learn Java, even just enough to create Plugins because I know if its something I need, someone else could use it as well. Haven't really been working on much Python, but I haven't given up on it. You guys rock! Stay Postive, Stay Humble. Love yall.
